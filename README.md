# theDailyWorld: A minimalistic Python world news program.

The inspiration behind this app is my frustration with the clutter on every news site. I've always wanted a news app that simply shows you the headlines, one per topic.

I'm also fascinated by the idea of a news app that gives you news from every country in one glance. So that's my eventual goal. 

As of now, I've added large, influential organizations in a section at the top of the page, and then the countries in order of largest population to smallest population.

In the future, I'd like to include the world's largest, most influential corporations, as well.
