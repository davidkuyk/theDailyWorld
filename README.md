## Background

> Feb 17, 2021: I've converted the app from a simple Python web scraping file to a fullstack Javascript webpage.

The inspiration behind The Daily World was my frustration with the clutter on every news site. I've always wanted a news site that simply shows you the headlines, one per topic. 

I'm also fascinated by the idea of a news site that gives you news from every country in one glance. So that's my eventual goal. 

As of now, I've added large, influential organizations in a section at the top of the page, and then the countries in order of largest to smallest population.

In the future, I'd like to include the world's largest, most influential corporations, as well.

## Installation

```sh
